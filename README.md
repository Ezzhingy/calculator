# calculator
On-screen calculator containing primary operations and keyboard support

Created with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. From this project, I learned how to:
- Build a larger-scale project from scratch
- Create a network of functions that call one another repeatedly
- Implement array and string manipulation

Overall, this project helped improve my layout designing and made me comfortable using the CSS and HTML tools at my disposal while also solidifying my JavaScript foundation.
